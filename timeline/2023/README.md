This is the code that is used having the data in excel sheet to be updating the html code with the excel sheet's data some conditions included ofcourse. 

It is written in vba() and was generated by Chat GPT on the following. Visual Basic Applications

I used the excel sheet available at the current Official website of PAMO.

*********************************************************
the prompt: 

I am using VBA 
 
this is the HTML code snippet:

<tr><td><a href="../../countries/KOR/.">Morocco</a></td><td align="right">1</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>3/td><td>2</td></tr>

I want top update the place where Morocco is written with column A data starting from A2.

I want to also update that place where number 1 is written so that it can increment.

I want to update the place where 5 is written with the result of this formula performed on the data that is in another worksheet called Final ranking:

=COUNTIFS(A:A, "Morocco",L:L, "Gold") 
you will update Morocco each time to make it the current data in column A. 

I want to update the place where 4 is written with the result of this formula performed on the data that is in another worksheet called Final ranking:

=COUNTIFS(A:A, "Morocco",L:L, "Silver") 
you will update Morocco each time to make it the current data in column A. 

I want to update the place where 3 is written with the result of this formula performed on the data that is in another worksheet called Final ranking:

=COUNTIFS(A:A, "Morocco",L:L, "Bronze") 
you will update Morocco each time to make it the current data in column A. 

I want to update the place where 2 is written with the result of this formula performed on the data that is in another worksheet called Final ranking:

=COUNTIFS(A:A, "Morocco",L:L, "Certificate") 
you will update Morocco each time to make it the current data in column A.

    lastRow = wsHTML.Cells(wsHTML.Rows.Count, 1).End(xlUp).Row
    
    ' Loop through each row in column A of the HTML worksheet
    For i = 2 To lastRow
